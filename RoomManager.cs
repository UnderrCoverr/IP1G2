// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaQlRvHgIvE video i used, follow this to see how to set up the camera triggers in the game world.
// make a gameobject, call it room, give it a Cinemachine virtual camera, give the Room a Polygon collider and match it up with the camera, add "room manager script" and link up the virtual camera with the correct Cinemachine camera
